# Powerwall Companion
Powerwall Companion is a Windows UWP app for monitoring your Tesla Powerwall 2 battery. 
It has similar functionality to the official Tesla app for Android/iOS, but it's designed to be 
more of an "always on" dashboard. The app was originally developed to run on Windows Phone, but
now that OS is no longer supported, the app only runs on Windows 10+ PCs. If you want to run this
on a phone, check out the Android version: ([Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirtyhippos.powerwallcompanionx) | [Source](https://github.com/tomhollander/PowerwallCompanionX))

The app is available to download from the Windows Store [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/powerwall-companion/9n3m45c4zcj4). 
The store is the easiest way to get the app, but I'm sharing the source in case anyone wants to improve it or is curious about the underlying APIs.

Powerwall Companion is completely free to use, but if you'd like to show your appreciation you can support me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tomhollander).
